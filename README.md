Description:
HTML
I first started this project by changing the div's to semantic elements in the proper locations. Such as, header, footer, section, aside, and so on.
I then went on to change the class name to an id for the search-engine-optimization link to allow it to work properly. I went on to add alt attributes to all of the images. I cleaned up the code by removing unnecessary class names because the images already had id names. I changed the the <h> to line up in sequential order. Finished by formatting the document to have correct and proper indencation.

CSS
In CSS i changed all of the class names to id names to line up with the changes i made in HTML. I changed the CSS selectors to the semantic elements i had also changed. Consolidated all of the CSS selectors that had the same property and value. Moved around the CSS selectors to follow the HTML sequential order.
